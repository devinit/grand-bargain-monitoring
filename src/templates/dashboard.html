		<h2></h2>

		<p>This bespoke dashboard was developed by <a href="http://devinit.org/">Development Initiatives</a> (DI) to support the Grand Bargain <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/greater-transparency">workstream on transparency</a> in taking forward commitments made by signatories at the World Humanitarian Summit 2016. It is part of the project <strong>Monitoring the Grand Bargain commitment on transparency</strong>. The dashboard is based on a framework and methodology for measuring the quality of humanitarian data published to IATI which is proposed in DI’s baseline report, <strong>Implementing and monitoring the Grand Bargain commitment on transparency</strong>, and subject to final approval.</p>

		<p>It is a tool that enables <a href="http://www.agendaforhumanity.org/initiatives/3861">Grand Bargain signatories</a> to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Check the quality of their humanitarian data published to the <a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net/">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> (IATI) Standard and identify areas requiring improvement.</li>
				<li>Assess their progress in meeting the <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/grand-bargain-hosted-iasc">commitment</a> to publish timely, high-quality, harmonised and transparent data on humanitarian funding.</li>
			</ol>

		<p>The dashboard is currently in beta version and is updated on a daily basis. It uses the data that organisations publish to the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/">IATI Standard</a> on the <a href="https://www.iatiregistry.org/">IATI Registry</a>.</p>

		<p>We welcome your feedback. Please send any comments or questions to Liz Steele at <a href="mailto:liz.steele@devinit.org">liz.steele@devinit.org</a>.</p>

		<h2>The monitoring framework and methodology</h2>

		<p>The monitoring framework and methodology explained below was developed by <a href="http://devinit.org/">Development Initiatives</a> based on feedback received from a consultation process with Grand Bargain signatory organisations and the wider humanitarian community from March to April 2017.</p>

		<h3>Methodology</h3>

		<p>The dashboard supports Grand Bargain signatory organisations to track:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The quality of the humanitarian data they publish to the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/">IATI Standard</a>, in terms of its structure rather than the content of the data.</li>
			<li>The progress signatories are making in meeting the Grand Bargain transparency <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/grand-bargain-hosted-iasc">commitment</a> to publish timely, high-quality, harmonised and transparent data on humanitarian funding.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The methodology measures the quality of humanitarian data an organisation publishes to the IATI Standard against five performance measures. Each of these performance measures has been given a percentage weighting that reflects its importance and/or relevance for the humanitarian community, based on feedback received through the consultation process.</p>

		<p>Five performance measures:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Humanitarian</strong>: to assess the use of the specific humanitarian elements added to the IATI Standard at version 2.02.</li>
			<li><strong>Timeliness</strong>: to assess both the frequency (how often the data is updated) and the time lag (how up to date the data is) of published information.</li>
			<li><strong>Comprehensiveness</strong>: to assess how much of the IATI Standard is being used. This covers:
				<ul>
					<li>Core IATI fields (e.g. title, description, start date)</li>
					<li>Financial fields (transaction and traceability information)</li>
					<li>Value-added fields (e.g. subnational location data, information on results).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Coverage*</strong>: to assess the percentage of an organisation's total operational spend on all humanitarian programming that is published to IATI.</li>
			<li><strong>Forward looking</strong>: to assess how much information on activity budgets is available for the next three years.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Organisations are given a percentage value for each of the measures, which are then aggregated into a single total value for each Grand Bargain signatory organisation.</p>

		<p>*Note that the percentage values for the <strong>coverage</strong> performance measure are currently not available. To calculate this, each Grand Bargain signatory organisation will be asked to provide a figure and an external reference (e.g. a link to their annual report) for their humanitarian spending for 2015 and 2016. Organisations will be contacted directly by the end of July 2017 and asked to provide this information.</p>

		<p>Detailed methodologies for each performance measure can be found on the IATI website via the links below.</p>

		<h3>Understanding the dashboard</h3>

		<p>
			<strong>Baseline:</strong> the total value for each Grand Bargain signatory organisation as of 1 June 2017.<br/>
			<strong>Total:</strong> the total value for each Grand Bargain signatory organisation at that point in time.<br/>
			<strong>Progress:</strong> the difference between the organisation’s <strong>total</strong> and <strong>baseline</strong> value. Any value greater than zero is coloured green.
		</p>

		<p>An organisation’s data will be classed as <strong>humanitarian</strong> if either of the following apply:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The activity includes a <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/sector/">DAC sector code</a> in the range 72010 to 74010.</li>
			<li>The <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/">activity humanitarian attribute</a> is set. (Note that the humanitarian attribute is only available to publishers using V2.02 or later of the IATI Standard.)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Meeting the commitment</h2>

		<p>An organisation’s overall assessment is based on the total value by quintile ratings in accordance with the table below. If a signatory organisation has met the Grand Bargain transparency commitment, it achieves an assessment of ‘good’ (60–79%) or above.</p>

		<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
			<tr>
				<th>Quintile</th>
				<th>Assessment</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>80% to 100%</td>
				<td>Very good</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>60% to 79%</td>
				<td>Good</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>40% to 59%</td>
				<td>Fair</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>20% to 39%</td>
				<td>Poor</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>0 to 19%</td>
				<td>Very poor</td>
			</tr>
